Rules of the Farming game (Using arrow keys)
- Interact with all of the boxes to collect all the crops
- Then, return home to sleep after a hard day's work

Uniqueness of my code
- In my Unit class 
  I have added 2 private members: int mCounter and bool IsInteract
  I have added the functions for Interactability and Counter
	*For every box that the farmer interacts with, the box no longer is interactable
	and the farmer's counter goes up by 1;

- In my main.cpp
  I have made several conditions to display certain images
  	*If each box is interactable, display the crop bubble
  	*If the farmer interacts with a box and that box is interactable, 
		the crop bubble of that box disappears, box is set non interactable, 
		farmer's counter goes up by 1;
	*If the farmer's counter is equal to 4, the house sleep bubble appears
	*Interacting with the house will set the farmer's counter to 0, display all crop bubbles,
		reset all boxes interactability, and house sleep bubble disappears
