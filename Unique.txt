Rules of the Farming game (Using arrow keys)
- Interact with all of the boxes to collect all the crops
- Then, return home to sleep after a hard day's work

Uniqueness of my code
- I'm still using the map class to draw the image of the background

- In my Unit class 
  I have added 2 private members: int mCounter and bool IsInteract.
  I have added functions for Interactability and Counter.
	*For every box that the farmer interacts with, the box no longer is interactable
	and the farmer's counter goes up by 1;

- In my main.cpp
  I have made several conditions to display certain images (Images such as boxes, garden plots, and house keep on displaying).
  	*If each box is interactable, display the crop bubble
  	*If the farmer interacts with a box and that box is interactable, 
		the crop bubble of that box disappears, box is set non interactable, 
		and farmer's counter goes up by 1;
	*If the farmer's counter is equal to 4, the house sleep bubble appears
	*Interacting with the house will set the farmer's counter to 0, display all crop bubbles,
		reset all boxes interactability, and house sleep bubble disappears


Most of the code I have written out are in the time complexity of O(1).
The conditionals in the main.cpp are mostly using accessors for its parameters and using mutators within the functions.
In other cases, they draw out the images.
